# TODO: Make Website Responsive for Desktop and Mobile

## Information Gathered
- Project uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Current responsive classes exist but need optimization
- Key components: Layout, ProductList, Cart, Checkout, AdminLayout, AdminLogin
- Layout uses flexbox and grid systems that can be improved

## Plan
1. Update Layout.jsx for better mobile navigation
2. Improve ProductList.jsx responsive grid and filters
3. Make Cart.jsx table mobile-friendly
4. Optimize Checkout.jsx form layout
5. Add mobile menu to AdminLayout.jsx
6. Test responsiveness across components

## Dependent Files to be edited
- src/components/Layout.jsx
- src/pages/ProductList.jsx
- src/pages/Cart.jsx
- src/pages/Checkout.jsx
- src/components/admin/AdminLayout.jsx

## Followup steps
